# 3D-Environments

After finishing my Coding Course at Makers with making a version of tetris in JS, I wanted to take on another similar challenge and get back to using C++. C++ being the language I started my coding journey with back in 2020. Although, I have nowhere near the level of knowledge I have now compared to back then. 

This project doesn't have a particular goal in mind. Just to utilised OpenGL, GLEW, GLM, and any other necessary dependencies to create a 3D environment from scratch and see what can be done with it
